## 💡 What Zeno Does (One-Line Description)

A personal AI assistant that co-creates your plans and tasks through conversation — then tracks your progress and keeps you aligned with your bigger goals.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Zeno solves this by:
- **Understanding** your goals through natural conversation
- **Planning** actionable steps that fit your life

## 🧭 Vision Statement

We envision a world where everyone has a personal AI coach that helps them:
- Transform scattered thoughts into structured plans
- Maintain consistency in pursuing their goals
- Achieve work-life balance through intelligent planning
- Build lasting habits that support their long-term vision
